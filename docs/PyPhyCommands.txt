Commands sent from PyPhyGUI to PyPhy:

id is a positive integer unique to each object that is used as an identifier for objects when communicating between programs

Creating a new Object:
new object id x y z width height depth r1 r2 r3
>>> construct an object with the given id at the given position and with the given dimensions and rotation
ex. new object 1 0 5 0 10 10 10 0 90 45

Moving an object:
move id xmodifier ymodifier zmodifier
>>> move the object with the given id as specified by the modifiers; this command modifies the object's existing location instead of setting the location
ex. move 1 0 -2 5 means add 0 to x, -2 to y, and 5 to z

Setting an object's location:
moveto id [options]
optional params:
-x - new x-coordinate
-y - new y-coordinate
-z - new z-coordinate
>>> move the object with the given id to the newly given coordinates
ex. move 1 -y 5 -x 24 -z 0
ex. move 2 -x 6
ex. move 3 

Resizing an Object:
resize id widthmodifier heightmodifier depthmodifier
>>> resize the object with the given id by the specified modifiers; this command modifies the object's existing size instead of setting its size
ex. resize 1 0 5 -10 means add 0 to width, 5 to height, and -10 to depth

Setting an Object's size:
setsize id [options]
optional params:
-w - new width
-h - new height
-d - new depth
>>> resize the object with the given id such that is has the given dimensions
ex. setsize 3 -w 25 -h 1
ex. setsize 1 -d 2 -w 1 -h 1
ex. setsize 5

Rotating an Object:
rotate id r1modifier r2modifier r3modifier
>>> rotate the object with the given id as specified by the modifiers; this command modifies the object's existing rotation instead of setting the rotation
ex. rotate 14 36 0 -792 means add 36 to r1, 0 to r2, and -45 to r3

Setting an Object's Rotation:
setrotation id [options]
optional params:
-r1 - new r1
-r2 - new r2
-r3 - new r3
>>> Set the object with the given id's rotation to the newly specified rotation
ex. setrotation 2 -r2 50
ex. setrotation 1 -r1 75 -r2 -72 -r3 1020
